# project9
comments from TA:
1) go through any unaddressed comments from me and user observations from prototype 1 and 2
2) [DONEish] make your buttons more affordable and consistent. Sometimes the buttons blue hyperlinked texts, sometimes it's a linked div with grey text, sometimes its a blue button, etc. Pick one button-y style and apply it across your webapp.
3) [DONE] although Places and Goals were never completed, make sure their navbar is consistent with the navbar from the other pages. (It currently shows the navbar from the first prototype)
4) [EMAILED NICO] address comments in the Component section of the rubric
