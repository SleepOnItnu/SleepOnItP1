Screens Needed:
emptycalendar - done
calendar - done

home - done
home1 - done
home2 - done
calendar_add (with no hard coded events) - done
calendar_add (with 1 hard coded event) - done
calendar_add (with both hard coded events) - not done, not needed bc user will not add anymore events

CHECK THAT NAVIGATION BAR works for different hard-coded screens: 
home ~ emptycalendar ~ calendar_add links to these two
home1 ~ calendar ~ calendar_add (with 1 hard coded event) links to these two
home2 ~ calendar2 ~ calendar_add (with 2 hard coded events) links to these two
